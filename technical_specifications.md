# Financial News Sentiment Analyzer: Technical Specifications

## Overview

The Financial News Sentiment Analyzer is a single-page Streamlit application designed to provide users with insights into the sentiment of financial news articles. Utilizing a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, the application will process user-provided or sample news articles, compute sentiment scores, and visually represent these scores. This aligns with the learning outcomes related to data processing, visualization, and user interaction within the synthetic dataset context.
