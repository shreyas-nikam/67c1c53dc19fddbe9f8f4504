            **Understanding Sentiment Analysis in Finance:**
            Sentiment analysis is crucial in finance as it helps in quantifying market sentiment from news, social media, and other textual data. 
            By understanding the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral), investors can gain insights into market trends and make informed decisions. 
            For example, consistently positive news sentiment about a company or sector might indicate a potential investment opportunity, while negative sentiment could signal risks.

            This application demonstrates a basic application of sentiment analysis. More advanced applications may involve:
            - **Time-series sentiment analysis:** Tracking sentiment changes over time to identify trends.
            - **Granular sentiment analysis:** Analyzing sentiment at a sentence or phrase level to understand nuances.
            - **Integration with market data:** Correlating sentiment scores with stock prices and other market indicators to build predictive models.

            **Reference:** This application is inspired by the concepts discussed in the document "Advances in Natural Language Understanding for Investment Management," particularly page 10, which highlights the significance of sentiment analysis in financial markets.
